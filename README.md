FEWD assignment 1

## Introductions
Hi, my name is Van.  
I am learning to become a _**front-end web developer**_, and hopefully one day a full stack developer.

### Things I enjoy:
* Learning new things
* Photography
* Spending time with family, especially my nieces and nephews.

### Here is a photo I took of a beautiful wreath my friend Ginger made herself:

Here is a website that I am currently working on re-designing and developing. [original website design](https://clearinsightpsychiatry.com/)
